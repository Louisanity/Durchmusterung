## Introduction

This project aims to investigate the feasibility of employing quantum-enhanced support vector machines (QSVMs) for stellar classification based on spectral data from the open source dataset\cite{Ku_KaggleStellar}. The core of the study involves designing and implementing a novel QSVM algorithm, which will be compared to traditional SVMs and Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) classification system, that is conventionally used in the field of stellar classification. Furthermore, the project seeks to explore the potential GPU acceleration techniques for the task of QSVM model training. Ultimately, this study will attempt to demonstrate the potential of quantum computing in enhancing the precision and efficiency of machine-learning approaches in astronomy.

## Feature Engineering

In order to facilitate quantum kernel learning, classical pre-processing methods can be utilized to decrease the dimensionality of the data or extract pertinent features prior to quantum kernel training. This approach can decrease the computational load and enhance the model's accuracy by decreasing noise and uncertainty associated with the quantum data. A technique for preparing the data for quantum kernel learning is to convert the quantum state into a different representation that is more suitable for machine learning methods. This may involve applying quantum circuits or other transformations to the data to extract valuable features.

There are 6 attributes provided in the original dataset. We believe only 2 of them, `B-V` and `Amag`, are relevant to the classification. They represents the B-V color index and absolute magnitude of the star, respectively. In addition,  we defined 4 more composite attributes. They are:
```math
\begin{align}
		&\texttt{Amag\_SQ} = \texttt{Amag}^2\\
    &\texttt{B-V\_SQ} = \texttt{B-V}^2\\
    &\texttt{B-V+Amag} = \texttt{B-V} + \texttt{Amag}\\
    &\texttt{B-V-Amag} = \texttt{B-V} - \texttt{Amag}
\end{align}
```


A detailed analysis of the relationship between target classification and other features is necessary, and a figure providing a visual representation of this relationship is shown below. We can find that composite features play a critical role in successfully amplifying even small variations, leading to further separation of peaks in the data. This suggests that composite features can improve the accuracy of target classification, especially in challenging cases.

## Quantum circuit

We employed a Second-order Pauli-Z evolution circuit, which utilizes two-qubit ZZ interaction to encode classical data into a quantum state. The circuit was repeated twice and entanglement was maximized. The QuantumKernel class was then used to compute the kernel function. The number of qubits is 6, which is equal to the number of features.

## Results

### Quantum Kernel Learning for Large Dataset

Our quantum kernel learning approach for star classification shows improved performance with increasing training data, surpassing the classical kernel in accuracy, f1 score, and specificity. The quantum kernel remains stable at around 0.9 in sensitivity, indicating its robustness. Our results suggest the superiority of the quantum kernel, which is more stable than the classical kernel, due to its ability to efficiently capture and process complex features.
